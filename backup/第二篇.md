HTML
General formatting
Use soft-tabs with a two space indent. Spaces are the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any person's environment.
Paragraphs of text should always be placed in a <p> tag. Never use multiple <br> tags.
Items in list form should always be in <ul>, <ol>, or <dl>. Never use a set of <div> or <p>.
Every form input that has text attached should utilize a <label> tag. Especially radio or checkbox elements.
Even though quotes around attributes is optional, always put quotes around attributes for readability.
Avoid writing closing tag comments, like <!-- /.element -->. This just adds to page load time. Plus, most editors have indentation guides and open-close tag highlighting.
Avoid trailing slashes in self-closing elements. For example, <br>, <hr>, <img>, and <input>.
Don't set tabindex manuallyâ€”rely on the browser to set the order.
